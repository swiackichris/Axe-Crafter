Android crafting game, gather resources, upgrade your tools, fight bosses, unlock new levels. 
I have decided to use as little assets as possible to further my skills. Most of the graphics are made by me, including all of the tools.
The rest of the graphics would take too long to make, and I would rather spend my time programming - which I enjoy the most :)

The game is currently in alpha state and will stay so for a while, as I have withheld further developing. I got to the point where improving the game and adding new functionalities was less beneficial to gaining new skills and knowledge than other activities. There is a good chance that I will finish this project in the future.
