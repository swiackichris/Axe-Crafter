// TODO NOW:

// Create different tree trunks to work with

// There should be a few different resources next to each other, and when one is chopped another one should appear,
// so that we can have forests this way

// - Tree Graphics x10
// - Monster Graphics x10

// Add different Scene for Each Minining.

// Minecraft Like Graphics for mines by depth

// Maybe make resources like this:http://www.textures4photoshop.com/tex/ground-dirt-and-sand/earth-ground-and-grass-cube-cross-section-isometric-free-stock-image.aspx
// Camera could go down as you click next level, slowly so that you can see that you go deeper, but for that you would need to edit graphics a little and make them in creative mode minecraft
// Make it so that you see a tiny bit of previous level on the next one. As in Mine0 Scene
// MAKE PNG VERSION OF JUST RESOURCES THAT WOULD SWITCH ROTATION SIZE AND PLACE CREATION (RANDOMIZE)
// THEY WOULD APPEAR ON TOP OF ALREADY CREATED EMPTY TEMPLATE
// MINES:
// - Dirt
// - Clay/Clay
// - Deep Dirt/Bone
// - Gravel/Flint
// - Aluminium/Aluminium
// - Iron/Iron
// - Silver/Silver
// - Gold/Gold
// - Platinum/Platinum
// - Titanium/Titanium
// - Diamond/Diamond

// - You could copy paste from albion and black desert online or other mmos as well




/// Figure out where to put these
// - Obsidian/Obsidian
// - Emerald Pickaxe
// - Gold
// - Aluminium
// - Iron
// - Diamond
// - Titanium
// - Bismuth
// - Silver
// - Platinum
// - Amethyst
// - Ruby
// - Saphhire

// FORESTS:
// - Trees can be made by connecting Trunks with random internet Leaves from actual leaves.
// - You can use any leaves png with minecraft trees
// - USE PHOTOSHOP FOR THIS
// - FOREST NEED TO LOOK LIKE FROM MINECRAFT WITH DIFFERENT COLORS :)
// - BACKGROUND COULD BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT FOR EACH TREE.
// - First 10 Forest should be whatever you think of first, doesn't have to make any sense, you can fix that later.
// - Maybe make a tree sample that could be edited? or Pixelize existing trees?
// - Balsa
// - White Pine
// - ChestNut
// - Birch
// - Oak
// - Sycamore
// - You could copy paste from albion and black desert online or other mmos as well


// MONSTERS:
// - You could copy paste from albion and black desert online or other mmos as well
// THE MOST CLASSIC MONSTERS IN GAMES
// - Orc
// - Troll
// - Elf
// - Dragon
// - Zuk
// - Wolf
// - Swine
// - Dog
// - Mouse
// - Tiger
// - Lion
// - Elephant


// Should Item Sprites be 8x8 or 16x16?
// Maybe it should be a combination of both?


// TODO MUCH LATER:

// X. Make Pickaxe crafting like in minecraft, gather materials, etc etc, and then you wait time to have it crafted in a forge and pay a blacksmith to do it.

// X. Each Pickaxe should have Hardness, Speed, Damage depending on the material it's made of

// X. You can add locks as other buttons who are children of buttons in level selection.

// X. There should be a way that a person has to choose which one he wants to master. Like Skills? You can add skills later.

// X. If you upgrade weapon to lvl 10 - the button should be a little bigger to properly display the amount of resources required to upgrade.

// X. Mine Levels Should be looking like in classic digger games, the deeper you go the more dark and evil the mine looks

// X. Add small randomization to the time, size and rotation of ores. Possibly could add color randomization to make them rare etc.
// Size could be proportional to the time waited?
// X. Add sounds
// X. Make ore Randomly appear on screen according to spawn points or not? If you destroy enough in time you pass to a new level?

// X. Walking in the mountains you encounter a nice looking stone, while picking it up you find more of them, You carry as much as you can home
// X. You buy a pickaxe with your last money to get the rest of nice looking stones, and so your adventure begins.
// X. You start with your hand not pickaxe.

// X. Monsters could grant experience per kill, then you would be able to 

// Z. Should Different Mines be unlocked from the start?
// X. Save Current Pickaxe Sprite
// X. You can monster with pickaxe if you want but this will deal less damage than with an axe

// X. Blood Animation or Wariety of Animations when Monster is hit example: Green Blood, Red Blood
// X. Possibly some rare loot needed to craft/enchant/upgrade? better weapons in the future

// X. Add Armor and Own Health because monsters should attack back? // Timer to kill a monster??

// X. 5~ Different Monsters in each Battle Level
// X. Modify and Improve Panel a Little

// X. Add Damage Numbers Appearing when monster is hit

// X. Improve Health Bars

// X. Load Mining Selection Screen from Each Different Mine
// X. Change Floats that don't need to be floats to int

// X. Remove unneccessary xxxscript for findobjectsoftype<SCRIPT>

// X. You could possibly make the code easier to read by replacing some lines with functions

// X. Damage and Health etc should be made into each different class?

// X. Possibly you will need to make Button.interactable.true after you gather ores. but for now it seems to work fine

// X. -1 Make a fluid rotation of pickaxe while pressing the button ( for example rotate 45 degrees during 1 second)

// ADD gold to game Screen??

// X. You could make a screen made of 1x1 blocks and randomize script where you can pick stones and randomly some ore could appear in the same 1x1 place
// https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/sampk-photo-realism-x512-hd/

// Think if you can remove parameter from Upgrade Axe and Upgrade Pick

// TODO LATER: There needs to be CheckForErrors() function that runs in start


/// GRAPHICS SHOULD BE PIXEL-ART MINECRAFT LIKE. POSSIBLY PICKAXES GLOW ETC SHOULD BE Better Graphics.
/// POSSIBLY IN THE FUTURE MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO BUILD A HOME OUT OF THOSE RESOURCES.

// THINGS TO LEARN AFTER YOU FINISH THIS PROJECT:
// - CODE STRUCTURE
// - C# and C++ Course
// - Unity Course
