// Scrollable Level Selection Screen
// 10 Different Scenes
// 10 Different monsters
// Fix Mining (Remove Up/Down replace with Mine Selection Screen)
// Load Mining Selection Screen from Each Different Mine
// Timer to kill a monster??
// Possibly change xScript to either xScriptPrefab or something like that. so that it's easier to know what prefab to put into a serializefield in unity.

// TODO LATER:
// If you upgrade weapon to lvl 10 - the button should be a little bigger to properly display the amount of resources required to upgrade.

// X. Add small randomization to the time, size and rotation of ores. Possibly could add color randomization to make them rare etc.
// Size could be proportional to the time waited?
// X. Add sounds

// X. Monsters could grant experience per kill, then you would be able to
