// TODO NOW:

// Work on Mine Level Manager

// Material Deduct must work properly

// - Levels unlocked need to be saved in GameSession
// - All other levels are locked (disabled) unless payment in resources is done
// - The closest level (enabled level + 1 should have another button enabled with enabled text and sprite of resource required as long as it doesn't reach 200/300 you can't press a button)
// - All the other disabled buttons should be disabled with LOCK Sprite on them that would be instatiated from script and removed from script.

// - Buttons should have different sprite which shows upgrade price, and shows current materials and gold let's say Gold Required: 1150/2000 etc
// - For this you need to figure out sprite changing for buttons in c#

// TODO LATER: There needs to be CheckForErrors() function that runs in start
// Think if you can remove parameter from Upgrade Axe and Upgrade Pick

// Add your own graphics for everything

// TODO MUCH LATER:

// X. You can add locks as other buttons who are children of buttons in level selection.

// X. There should be a way that a person has to choose which one he wants to master. Like Skills? You can add skills later.

// X. If you upgrade weapon to lvl 10 - the button should be a little bigger to properly display the amount of resources required to upgrade.

// X. Mine Levels Should be looking like in classic digger games, the deeper you go the more dark and evil the mine looks

// X. Add small randomization to the time, size and rotation of ores. Possibly could add color randomization to make them rare etc.
// Size could be proportional to the time waited?
// X. Add sounds
// X. Make ore Randomly appear on screen according to spawn points or not? If you destroy enough in time you pass to a new level?

// X. Walking in the mountains you encounter a nice looking stone, while picking it up you find more of them, You carry as much as you can home
// X. You buy a pickaxe with your last money to get the rest of nice looking stones, and so your adventure begins.
// X. You start with your hand not pickaxe.

// X. Monsters could grant experience per kill, then you would be able to 

// Z. Should Different Mines be unlocked from the start?
// X. Save Current Pickaxe Sprite
// X. You can monster with pickaxe if you want but this will deal less damage than with an axe

// X. Blood Animation or Wariety of Animations when Monster is hit example: Green Blood, Red Blood
// X. Possibly some rare loot needed to craft/enchant/upgrade? better weapons in the future

// X. Add Armor and Own Health because monsters should attack back? // Timer to kill a monster??

// X. 5~ Different Monsters in each Battle Level
// X. Modify and Improve Panel a Little

// X. Add Damage Numbers Appearing when monster is hit

// X. Improve Health Bars

// X. Load Mining Selection Screen from Each Different Mine
// X. Change Floats that don't need to be floats to int

// X. Remove unneccessary xxxscript for findobjectsoftype<SCRIPT>

// X. You could possibly make the code easier to read by replacing some lines with functions

// X. Damage and Health etc should be made into each different class?

// X. Possibly you will need to make Button.interactable.true after you gather ores. but for now it seems to work fine

// X. -1 Make a fluid rotation of pickaxe while pressing the button ( for example rotate 45 degrees during 1 second)

// ADD gold to game Screen??


/// GRAPHICS SHOULD BE PIXEL-ART MINECRAFT LIKE. POSSIBLY PICKAXES GLOW ETC SHOULD BE Better Graphics.
/// POSSIBLY IN THE FUTURE MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO BUILD A HOME OUT OF THOSE RESOURCES.

// THINGS TO LEARN AFTER YOU FINISH THIS PROJECT:
// - CODE STRUCTURE
// - C# and C++ Course
// - Unity Course
