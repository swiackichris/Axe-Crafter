// TODO NOW:

// Sometimes tool rotates backwards infinitly

// Random Between 2 Gradients particles :)

// X. Increase Pick Upgrade Cost by 10% per each level of upgrade from a standard cost, and to buy a nerw pickaxe the cost should be 10x of initial.

// X. Add small randomization to the time, Possibly could add color randomization to make them rare etc.

// X. Replace dark sprites for scenes, buttons in main menu etc, with sprites that are easily visible even on low brightness phone

// X. Tool should smoothly travel towards a tree and attack when pressed?



// X. Add Random Damage Numbers Appearing when monster is hit

// X. Add a way to choose a weapon

// X. Add Tool Hardness
// Hardness needs to grow with upgrade level.

// Big Blood Splatter Particle when monster is killed

// Reset Game Session ore gather gold etc.
// Beta Release The Game




















// OTHER IDEAS:

// X. Instantiate 5 or more trees/ore as buttons and then you can press each one and each one has its own health.

// X. Increase glow around a weapon, the higher the upgrade

// Make a game session prefab that works across all the scenes and reset values.
// - Make sure before making a prefab and deleting old ones, that you can easily replace it with a prefab.
// - Plan it properly.

// Add wooden frame on top of the buttons like in this screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/LDNaIed.png

// Remove unneccessary unused things from each scene, organize and name everything properly

// If you instantiate a monster/pickaxe/axe you could propably use transform.position of a prefab maybe?

// Should there be damage added?

// Optimize long code into short functions

// - When monster is killed add death sound?

// You dig first dirt to find a sharp stone
// You use first sharp stone to cut first tree and make wooden shovel

// - If Hardness isn't high enough, it takes (Hardness Required - Tool Hardness)^1.5 times longer to mine a resource

// X. Should Hardness Make it possible to mine harder ores?

// X. Make Pickaxe crafting like in minecraft, gather materials, etc etc, and then you wait time to have it crafted in a forge and pay a blacksmith to do it.

// X. Stats should increase 10% each and in final stage 50%~.

// X. Each Pickaxe should have Hardness, Speed, Damage depending on the material it's made of

// X. There should be a way that a person has to choose which one he wants to master. Like Skills? You can add skills later.

// X. Mine Levels Should be looking like in classic digger games, the deeper you go the more dark and evil the mine looks

// Ore spawned size could be proportional to the time waited for new spawn?

// X. Walking in the mountains you encounter a nice looking stone, while picking it up you find more of them, You carry as much as you can home
// X. You buy a pickaxe with your last money to get the rest of nice looking stones, and so your adventure begins.

// X. Monsters could grant experience per kill, then you would be able to spend it on skills 

// X. You can attack monster with pickaxe if you want but this will deal less damage than with an axe

// X. Possibly some rare loot needed to craft/enchant/upgrade? better weapons in the future

// X. Add Armor and Own Health because monsters should attack back? // Timer to kill a monster??

// X. Add a way to upgrade a tool/weapon to unlimited +X

// X. 5~ Different Monsters in each Battle Level?

// X. You could make a screen made of 1x1 blocks and randomize script where you can pick stones and randomly some ore could appear in the same 1x1 place
// https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/sampk-photo-realism-x512-hd/

// Think if you can remove parameter from Upgrade Axe and Upgrade Pick

// ??? There needs to be CheckForErrors() function that runs in start ???

// Camera could go down as you click next level, slowly so that you can see that you go deeper, but for that you would need to edit graphics a little and make them in creative mode minecraft
// Make it so that you see a tiny bit of previous level on the next one. As in Mine0 Scene
// MAKE PNG VERSION OF JUST RESOURCES THAT WOULD SWITCH ROTATION SIZE AND PLACE CREATION (RANDOMIZE)
// THEY WOULD APPEAR ON TOP OF ALREADY CREATED EMPTY TEMPLATE


/// GRAPHICS SHOULD BE PIXEL-ART MINECRAFT LIKE. POSSIBLY PICKAXES GLOW ETC SHOULD BE Better Graphics.
/// POSSIBLY IN THE FUTURE MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO BUILD A HOME OUT OF THOSE RESOURCES.

// THINGS TO LEARN AFTER YOU FINISH THIS PROJECT:
// - CODE STRUCTURE
// - C# and C++ Course
// - Unity Course

// You could make repeatable levels like in Idle Heroes in Campaign with forests battle and mines.
// Maybe you can find some monster graphics in unity free assets

// Check maybe there are some tools online to pixelise graphics to make them look like minecraft
