// TODO NOW:

// Change Back Buttons to Arrow Button
// Add Mine Levels 3D Graphics - Resources would appear in the correct area not on whole screen (Make mine screenshot from inside)
// generated dungeon

// Add Graphics to all buttons
// add texts to all buttons

// Mine Button Graphics

// Health of Ore Trees and Monsters
// Damage of Pickaxes and Axes
// Costs of Pickaxes and Axes

// You dig first dirt to find a sharp stone
// You use first sharp stone to cut first tree and make wooden shovel
// You use wooden shovel to dig deep dirt bones
// Use bones + first wood to make a bone axe

// - Add spawn points like in your spaceship project so that monsters/trees can randomly respawn on them

// Graphics that need to be done:
// - Buttons
// - Healthbar
// - Shop Scene, Menu etc

// Sound needed
// - Pickaxe Sound
// - Axe Sound
// - Mine Scene Sound
// - Forest Scene Sound
// - Battle Scene Sound
// - Sounds for each different monster? Just make a Axe Hit flesh sound instead

// Should Item Sprites be 8x8 or 16x16?
// Maybe it should be a combination of both?

// TODO MUCH LATER:

// X. Solve Button Selection Colors text not being affected by button color

// X. Make Pickaxe crafting like in minecraft, gather materials, etc etc, and then you wait time to have it crafted in a forge and pay a blacksmith to do it.

// X. Each Pickaxe should have Hardness, Speed, Damage depending on the material it's made of

// X. You can add locks as other buttons who are children of buttons in level selection.

// X. There should be a way that a person has to choose which one he wants to master. Like Skills? You can add skills later.

// X. If you upgrade weapon to lvl 10 - the button should be a little bigger to properly display the amount of resources required to upgrade.

// X. Mine Levels Should be looking like in classic digger games, the deeper you go the more dark and evil the mine looks

// X. Add small randomization to the time, size and rotation of ores. Possibly could add color randomization to make them rare etc.
// Size could be proportional to the time waited?
// X. Add sounds
// X. Make ore Randomly appear on screen according to spawn points or not? If you destroy enough in time you pass to a new level?

// X. Walking in the mountains you encounter a nice looking stone, while picking it up you find more of them, You carry as much as you can home
// X. You buy a pickaxe with your last money to get the rest of nice looking stones, and so your adventure begins.
// X. You start with your hand not pickaxe.

// X. Monsters could grant experience per kill, then you would be able to 

// Z. Should Different Mines be unlocked from the start?
// X. Save Current Pickaxe Sprite
// X. You can monster with pickaxe if you want but this will deal less damage than with an axe

// X. Blood Animation or Wariety of Animations when Monster is hit example: Green Blood, Red Blood
// X. Possibly some rare loot needed to craft/enchant/upgrade? better weapons in the future

// X. Add Armor and Own Health because monsters should attack back? // Timer to kill a monster??

// X. 5~ Different Monsters in each Battle Level
// X. Modify and Improve Panel a Little

// X. Add Damage Numbers Appearing when monster is hit

// X. Improve Health Bars

// X. Load Mining Selection Screen from Each Different Mine
// X. Change Floats that don't need to be floats to int

// X. Remove unneccessary xxxscript for findobjectsoftype<SCRIPT>

// X. You could possibly make the code easier to read by replacing some lines with functions

// X. Damage and Health etc should be made into each different class?

// X. Possibly you will need to make Button.interactable.true after you gather ores. but for now it seems to work fine

// X. -1 Make a fluid rotation of pickaxe while pressing the button ( for example rotate 45 degrees during 1 second)

// ADD gold to game Screen??

// X. You could make a screen made of 1x1 blocks and randomize script where you can pick stones and randomly some ore could appear in the same 1x1 place
// https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/sampk-photo-realism-x512-hd/

// Think if you can remove parameter from Upgrade Axe and Upgrade Pick

// TODO LATER: There needs to be CheckForErrors() function that runs in start

// Camera could go down as you click next level, slowly so that you can see that you go deeper, but for that you would need to edit graphics a little and make them in creative mode minecraft
// Make it so that you see a tiny bit of previous level on the next one. As in Mine0 Scene
// MAKE PNG VERSION OF JUST RESOURCES THAT WOULD SWITCH ROTATION SIZE AND PLACE CREATION (RANDOMIZE)
// THEY WOULD APPEAR ON TOP OF ALREADY CREATED EMPTY TEMPLATE


/// GRAPHICS SHOULD BE PIXEL-ART MINECRAFT LIKE. POSSIBLY PICKAXES GLOW ETC SHOULD BE Better Graphics.
/// POSSIBLY IN THE FUTURE MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO BUILD A HOME OUT OF THOSE RESOURCES.
