// TODO

// 1. Make a shop where you could buy pickaxes for resources, to start with they would only have different sprite
// 2. Figure out a way to display pickaxe cost for each different pickaxe.
// 3. Optimize TODO & UpgradePick Script

// Main focus: When Button hits +9 -> Show resources required for an upgrade.

// Amount of Ores owned should be displayed on the bottom.

// 1.1 Make everything savable
// 1.2 Make 2 new sprites
// 1.3 Make 10 new working sprites
// 2. Add Damage to Pickaxe
// 3. Add Different Resource Cost
// 4. Add Woodcutting

// IFNO:
// If you upgrade weapon to lvl 10 - the button should be a little bigger to properly display the amount of resources required to upgrade.

// Z. Format the code.

// X. Add small randomization to the time, size and rotation of ores. Possibly could add color randomization to make them rare etc.
// Size could be proportional to the time waited?
// X. Add sounds
// X. Make ore Randomly appear on screen according to spawn points or not? If you destroy enough in time you pass to a new level?

// X. Walking in the mountains you encounter a nice looking stone, while picking it up you find more of them, You carry as much as you can home
// X. You buy a pickaxe with your last money to get the rest of nice looking stones, and so your adventure begins.
// X. You start with your hand not pickaxe.

// Z. Should Different Mines be unlocked from the start?

// X - Do these in the end
// Z - Important things to figure out


/// GRAPHICS SHOULD BE PIXEL-ART MINECRAFT LIKE. POSSIBLY PICKAXES GLOW ETC SHOULD BE Better Graphics.
