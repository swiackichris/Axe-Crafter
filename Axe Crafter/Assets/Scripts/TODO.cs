// TODO NOW:

// Make a detailed TODO plan

// Fixing a problem with saving both ore and wood, and should you be having OreMinedText.Size = 0? Remove 
// That Warning and possibly replace it with some other warning. MinedOreCounterShould be 0
// 1. Copy everything wood related to gameSessionScript
// CurrentAxeDamage in Wood
// - Copy Scripts
// - Add GameSessionScripts for axes
// 2. Add Axe Shop
// 3. Add Wood Cost
// - You were editing scenes, to copy wood1 -> wood10
// Fix Comments in Wood
// Add warnings to pickaxeprices script: if Pickaxeprices[] isn't equal to OreMinedcounter[] Also WoodRequired[].Length has to be equal to OreRequired[]
// - Figure out to display all resources available at the moment, possibly make it scrollable?
// - By clicking a button inside pick crafter you should make an illusion of switching "button would be marked as Woodcutting from Pickaxe" but in fact it would switch scene instead.
// - Axes and Pickaxes should maybe cost 2 different ore and 2 different wood?

// @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
// @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
// Add Gold Count
// Add Woodcutting
// Add Prices for Different Axes
// 2 January -> format the PC?
// Make code easier to read by replacing complicated code with functions with a description

// TODO LATER: There needs to be CheckForErrors() function that runs in start
// What needs to be finished for the game to be finished:
// Added Woodcutting, Added Axe Shop -> Possibly connect them together?
// Goal of this game is simply killing further Boss and Gathering Further Ore, 
// Add your own graphics for everything
// but there should be a way that a person has to choose which one he wants to master. Like Skills? You can add skills later.

// TODO MUCH LATER:
// X. If you upgrade weapon to lvl 10 - the button should be a little bigger to properly display the amount of resources required to upgrade.

// X. Mine Levels Should be looking like in classic digger games, the deeper you go the more dark and evil the mine looks

// X. Add small randomization to the time, size and rotation of ores. Possibly could add color randomization to make them rare etc.
// Size could be proportional to the time waited?
// X. Add sounds
// X. Make ore Randomly appear on screen according to spawn points or not? If you destroy enough in time you pass to a new level?

// X. Walking in the mountains you encounter a nice looking stone, while picking it up you find more of them, You carry as much as you can home
// X. You buy a pickaxe with your last money to get the rest of nice looking stones, and so your adventure begins.
// X. You start with your hand not pickaxe.

// X. Monsters could grant experience per kill, then you would be able to 

// Z. Should Different Mines be unlocked from the start?
// X. Save Current Pickaxe Sprite
// X. You can monster with pickaxe if you want but this will deal less damage than with an axe

// X. Blood Animation or Wariety of Animations when Monster is hit example: Green Blood, Red Blood
// X. Possibly some rare loot needed to craft/enchant/upgrade? better weapons in the future

// X. Add Armor and Own Health because monsters should attack back? // Timer to kill a monster??

// X. 5~ Different Monsters in each Battle Level
// X. Modify and Improve Panel a Little

// X. Add Damage Numbers Appearing when monster is hit

// X. Improve Health Bars

// X. Load Mining Selection Screen from Each Different Mine
// X. Change Floats that don't need to be floats to int

// X. Remove unneccessary xxxscript for findobjectsoftype<SCRIPT>

// X. You could possibly make the code easier to read by replacing some lines with functions

// X. Damage and Health etc should be made into each different class?

// X. Possibly you will need to make Button.interactable.true after you gather ores. but for now it seems to work fine

// X. -1 Make a fluid rotation of pickaxe while pressing the button ( for example rotate 45 degrees during 1 second)

// ADD gold to game Screen??


/// GRAPHICS SHOULD BE PIXEL-ART MINECRAFT LIKE. POSSIBLY PICKAXES GLOW ETC SHOULD BE Better Graphics.
/// POSSIBLY IN THE FUTURE MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO BUILD A HOME OUT OF THOSE RESOURCES.

// THINGS TO LEARN AFTER YOU FINISH THIS PROJECT:
// - CODE STRUCTURE
// - C# and C++ Course
// - Unity Course
