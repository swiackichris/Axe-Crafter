// TODO NOW:

// Need a function that could check if the value > 0;
// Figure out a way to Add only those prices that aren't 0
// Add Pickaxe Prices Serialize them or something
// Add Woodcutting
// Add Prices for Different Axes
// Think about what TODO next, possibly just polish the game and release
// Add warnings to pickaxeprices script: if Pickaxeprices[] isn't equal to OreMinedcounter[] Also WoodRequired[].Length has to be equal to OreRequired[]
// Display UpgradePriceSprite has to be done the same way.
// Fix all the functions with a function like: private void ProcessHit(DamageDealer damageDealer);

// TODO LATER:
// If you upgrade weapon to lvl 10 - the button should be a little bigger to properly display the amount of resources required to upgrade.

// X. Add small randomization to the time, size and rotation of ores. Possibly could add color randomization to make them rare etc.
// Size could be proportional to the time waited?
// X. Add sounds
// X. Make ore Randomly appear on screen according to spawn points or not? If you destroy enough in time you pass to a new level?

// X. Walking in the mountains you encounter a nice looking stone, while picking it up you find more of them, You carry as much as you can home
// X. You buy a pickaxe with your last money to get the rest of nice looking stones, and so your adventure begins.
// X. You start with your hand not pickaxe.

// X. Monsters could grant experience per kill, then you would be able to 

// Z. Should Different Mines be unlocked from the start?
// X. Save Current Pickaxe Sprite
// X. You can monster with pickaxe if you want but this will deal less damage than with an axe

// X. Blood Animation or Wariety of Animations when Monster is hit example: Green Blood, Red Blood
// X. Possibly some rare loot needed to craft/enchant/upgrade? better weapons in the future

// X. Add Armor and Own Health because monsters should attack back? // Timer to kill a monster??

// X. 5~ Different Monsters in each Battle Level
// X. Modify and Improve Panel a Little

// X. Add Damage Numbers Appearing when monster is hit

// X. Improve Health Bars

// X. Load Mining Selection Screen from Each Different Mine
// X. Change Floats that don't need to be floats to int

// X. Remove unneccessary xxxscript for findobjectsoftype<SCRIPT>

// ADD gold to game Screen??


/// GRAPHICS SHOULD BE PIXEL-ART MINECRAFT LIKE. POSSIBLY PICKAXES GLOW ETC SHOULD BE Better Graphics.
/// POSSIBLY IN THE FUTURE MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO BUILD A HOME OUT OF THOSE RESOURCES.
