// X. Add small randomization to the time, size and rotation of ores. Possibly could add color randomization to make them rare etc.
// Size could be proportional to the time waited?
// X. Add sounds
// X. Make ore Randomly appear on screen according to spawn points or not? If you destroy enough in time you pass to a new level?
